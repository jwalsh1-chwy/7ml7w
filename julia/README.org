** Setup

There were several issues that needed to be resolved with the install:

- https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/33545
- https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/58558

After removing Julia 0.x you should be able to run the following:

#+begin_src sh
make setup
make
#+end_src

The following can be used to verify the setup:

#+begin_src julia
using DataFrames

df = DataFrame(A = 1:4, B = ["M", "F", "F", "M"])

#+end_src
